I am a a qualified and professional Senior Machine Learning Engineer with 11 years of experience in
developing Machine Learning projects.
Having worked for several companies, as a distributed team member or leader, I have a strong ability in the
various of advanced machine learning algorithms and libraries.
Implemented 17+ big AI projects successfully and developed 30+ new important algorithms.



-Developed molecular dynamics simulations using machine learning algorithms to
identify protein-DNA interactions with up to 95% fidelity
-Improved accuracy of simulation up to 30% using various algorithms.
-Designed and completed analysis systems to extract information from large scale
data.
-Predicted product sales to within 2% by applying logistic regression model.



-Designed, tested and deployed machine learning models for several projects
related to marketing and gained about worth $10M in total.
-Developed, improved and implemented the statistical modeling for time series
analysis such as temperature-forecasting, prediction of stock price with Python.

-Designed and executed well-engineered, easy-to-maintain, reliable, and bug-free
code for various company applications in collaboration with other AI engineers,
data scientists, programmers, and software personnel.
-Analyzed datasets using appropriate statistical techniques and models (e.g. linear
regression, logistic regression, polynomial regression, support vector
machine,decision tree and random forest) to examine how two tests are potentially
related as well as explain the effect of four demographic variables with Python,
Scikit-learn, Pandas.
